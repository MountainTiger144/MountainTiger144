# âš™ Socket Development

Socket is a Discord Bot that I founded on the 12th, August 2021. My original purpose for the bot was nothing but to help me understand the newest version of [Discord.JS](https://discord.js.org/) (v13). This eventually turned into making a full bot [Support Server](https://support.socketbot.xyz) on Discord, and getting others to contribute to the project. None of this would have been possible withought [Nimbi](https://github.com/PhantomNimbi), who gratefully let/helped me host Socket on his servers. He also coded the website [socketbot.xyz](https://socketbot.xyz) and has contributed to code of the bot!

Socket also has its own [documentation/guide](https://docs.socketbot.xyz/), hosted on [Gitbook](https://gitbook.io/), which includes everything you need to know about Socket and it's commands.

I'd like to thank everyone who've Contributed in any way to this project! That's why, in our [documentation](https://docs.socketbot.xyz/), under the "[Acknowledgement](https://docs.socketbot.xyz/other/acknowledgement)" page, Contributors, Developers and [Patreons](https://www.patreon.com/socketbot) will find their names listed forever.
